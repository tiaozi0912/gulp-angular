                li The Agora SDK sends information to Agora’ servers so we can connect calls and for quality and reporting purposes. The information includes date/time, from/to information, setup time, call duration and failure calls. Information is uploaded by the client in the background at the end of a call, a call failure or a similar event. While some of this information may be associated with the user ids of the call participants, it’s important to know that as a developer, you do not need to provide meaningful user ids to the SDK (you could provide hashed user ids, for example).
