p Games that require real-time cooperation work best when that cooperation is voice-based. You can easily bring users of multi-player games together using Agora. Players will no longer need to wonder what other users are thinking, or experience slow communication due to typing text. Giving players the ability to verbally communicate through Agora makes the gaming experience more interactive and fun.
