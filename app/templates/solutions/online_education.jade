p Education should be accessible to everyone, everywhere. Agora offers both students and teachers an ideal online platform to exchange ideas while creating an effective, stable and private learning environment. Agora gives students the ability to access private tutors online without requiring them to leave their own home. Not only is this convenient, but the personal, one-on-one connection Agora provides via its crystal clear voice quality makes students more likely to engage enthusiastically with their learning material.
p Agora not only provides an option to chat privately with a tutor, but can also be utilized by many users at once, allowing online instructors to communicate with their students as a whole in order to simulate a highly realistic and engaging classroom setting. Since classmates can talk to one another through Agora in real time, no matter their location, organizing study groups through Agora could not get any easier. Agoraâ€™s concise, easy-to-use interface makes it simple for students oceans apart to start conversations and share ideas, either privately or in a group setting.
