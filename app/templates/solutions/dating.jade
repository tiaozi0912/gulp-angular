p With the recent explosion of the online dating industry, dating sites are increasingly striving to differentiate themselves in a competitive market, offering top-tier features to enhance the user experience.

p On many dating sites, users in the early stages of getting to know each other do not want to give away personal information. Phone numbers are particularly sensitive data that users prefer to keep private, at least initially. Integrating Agora into a dating website or app allows users to easily make calls from within the site or app, offering the personal feel of a voice conversation while eliminating privacy concerns.

p With anonymous calling, users can communicate exclusively within your app or website while knowing that their privacy is safeguarded through Agora’s technology. This helps to keep voice communication within a controlled environment and limits the use of third party networks (social media, email) for dating communication. Offensive content is also limited in this way. Help your dating service stay ahead of the curve by implementing Agora’s VoIP.
