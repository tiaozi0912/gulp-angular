p Though many dating sites are increasingly striving to differentiate themselves in a competitive market by offering top-tier features to enhance user experience, few can provide both the intimacy and the personal security that Agora can bring to its users. At first, couples may feel uncomfortable exchanging sensitive data such as phone numbers, but integrating Agora into a dating website or app allows users to easily make calls from within the site or app, which provides the personal feel of a phone conversation while still eliminating privacy concerns.

p With anonymous calling, users can communicate exclusively within your app or website while knowing that their privacy is safeguarded through Agora’s technology. This helps to keep voice communication within a controlled environment and limits the use of third party networks (social media, email) for dating communication. Offensive content is also limited in this way. Help your dating service stay ahead of the curve by implementing Agora’s VoIP.
