p Agora aims to give its users a new, secure way to connect with the people around them. With Agora, you can connect users quickly and easily by adding a call feature directly within your app. You can use Agora Voice API to bring voice calls to your users with the click of a button, allowing clear, direct voice connections with friends, family and businesses alike.

p Agoraâ€™s anonymous call feature is particularly useful for connections wherein two users may not have the desire nor necessity to exchange personal phone numbers. For example, this feature may be used for one-time business interactions, service calls, or online dating. Additionally, since users can call other users from directly within the app, using anonymous calling also eliminates the need for a temporary number, which allows for easy user management and call monitoring. By operating with Agora, you are ensuring the privacy and security of every one of your users
